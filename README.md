# ML-Knowledge-Based-Models-for-GNR-Interconnects
We have developed various Machine Learning Models for predicting Mean Free Path (MFP) due to scattering by edge roughness at different parameters such as
predicting MFP due to scattering by edge roughness at given fermi energy, predicting the effective MFP of electrons in GNR at given wavelength,  
predicting the effective MFP of electrons in GNR at given fermi energy, predicting the number of layers in MLGNR at given thickness,
predicting scattering resistance, lumped resistance and quantum resistance resulting in the prediction of the total resistance.
